# **Formation Evaluation System**
platform accessible on elevatio.me
## **Project Overview**
This is a **web application** designed to **automate and streamline the evaluation of engineering programs** in higher education. The system helps reduce manual processes and provides actionable insights for improving the quality of programs, specifically in the **Computer Science** field.

## **Context**
Currently, training evaluations are often handled manually through paper forms, Excel sheets, or emails, which complicates data analysis and limits the effectiveness of improvement actions. This application aims to centralize and automate the process, providing users (students, teachers, and professionals) with an easy-to-use platform for submitting feedback and providing administrators with tools to analyze the results and optimize the programs.

## **Objectives**
- Automate the evaluation process to reduce manual intervention and errors.
- Simplify the collection and analysis of feedback from students, teachers, and other stakeholders.
- Provide detailed reports and visual statistics to support decision-making.
- Offer a user-friendly and intuitive interface for all user profiles.
- Ensure data security and confidentiality throughout the evaluation process.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: **Next.js**
- **Backend**: **ASP.NET Core**, using a microservices-based architecture.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** or **SQL Server**.

## **Development Methodology**
This project uses a **DevOps approach** for continuous integration, automated deployment, and high reliability. We follow the **Scrum methodology** for task management, utilizing **Jira** for sprint tracking.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
